Top Populous Countries - Population Animation
This project visualizes the population growth of the top 10 most populous countries in the world from 2010 to 2023 using an animated horizontal bar chart.

Overview
Data Source: World Bank population dataset (total population, yearly from 2010 to 2023).

Countries Included: India, China, United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russian Federation, and Mexico.

Visualization: Animated horizontal bar chart showing population changes over time with clear population labels on each bar.

Animation: Displays one frame per year with population values formatted in billions (B), millions (M), or thousands (K) for readability.

Tools Used: Python with pandas, matplotlib for plotting and animation, and IPython.display for rendering the animation inline in Jupyter notebooks.

Data Accessibility: The population data CSV is hosted on GitHub and loaded directly via its raw URL, making the project reproducible and easy to run by others without manual data download.

How to run
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, IPython).

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

The animation will display population growth dynamically for the selected countries over the years 2010-2023.
